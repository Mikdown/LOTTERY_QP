# Lottery-Picker
### Lottery-Picker is a data analysis project which is designed to identify if meteoroligical conditions at the time and place of the drawing have any affect on the winning mubers drawn. By importing, cleaning, and transforming all historic lottery(MegaMillions) winning number data available and ten years of meteoroligical data for the drawing site(Atlanta, GA.) a comparison analysis is done.

   ## Setup virtual environment:

   ### It is recommended to create a python virtual environment so you do not pollute your working folder:
      
        1. In a Terminal App or Terminal window in your IDE navigate to the /Lottery-Picker folder.
            - To create a virtual environment named "venv" enter: python -m venv venv
            - To activate the virtual environment enter:
                - Unix/MacOS enter: source venv/bin/activate
                - Windows enter: venv\Scripts\activate

        2. While in the venv shell enter: pip install -r requirements.txt
